0:00
good morning everybody okay you guys are slightly more awake than the last service i appreciate that
0:07
uh can you imagine coming out of like Space Camp recap and the crowd is like
0:14
uh it's a little anticlimactic anyway my name's Eric i'm one of the guys on the team around here and I just want to
0:20
pause and celebrate for a minute what what we just watched what happened that 24 hours ago this room was filled uh
0:28
with the next generation just worshiping their hearts out for God and just want to honor we don't talk a lot about
0:33
numbers around here but just the the scope of everything God's doing we had 430 kids here for the last three days
0:39
with over 150 volunteers that we want to thank uh staff members that went above
0:45
and beyond and spouses and families that that sacrificed with their uh their
0:50
significant other being gone it's just a lot of my career was in kids and student ministry and so camp has a very special
0:57
place in my heart and just it's amazing to watch what God's doing anyway uh if I
1:03
seem slightly out of sorts this morning it is because a little over a week ago my wife had a total knee replacement uh
1:09
and I have been home all week pretending I know anything about nursing um she
1:14
would I sorry I should pause she would want me to disclaim uh yes she is quite young for that procedure thanks for
1:20
noticing uh she would also want you to know she was an elite athlete in high
1:25
school and blew out her knee and over three surgeries and complications within
1:30
those surgeries it set her up for requiring this so I think I got that right sweetheart you're welcome i have
1:36
uh disclaimed for you um but here's the only problem with that i love serving my
1:41
wife it is no trouble to keep track of the the medicine schedule and the ice and helping her get anywhere
1:49
except that when it comes to the human body virtually nothing grosses me out like blood guts fluids don't care bones
1:58
really make me squeamish um so as I'm at home helping her with like these PT
2:03
exercises I actively have to not think about what's going on in there or what has taken place and grinding and cutting
2:10
i guys I can't do it um it is it is so bad this is I'm not proud of this but
2:16
here we're we're being real here uh during the birth of our third child my wife opted for an epidural uh and so
2:22
she's got like all the medical personnel getting her prepped for that and I wanted to be there for her but I knew I
2:28
couldn't be there for her so I'm kind of off to the side and I'm distinctly looking away trying not to think about
2:34
what's going on and all I can see on a loop in my head is the video that they make you watch at the birthing class
2:40
that you have to go to together and some of you guys have seen this it's like the cartoon needle that's going into the
2:45
disc between the vertebrae i need to stabilize myself um that is just playing
2:50
in a loop and I'm like "Oh that is that is rough i don't feel so good." Um this isn't about me she's giving birth to a
2:57
child uh and then suddenly I feel the very strong hand of a nurse on my shoulder and she forcefully sits me down
3:04
on this stool like the actual doctor's stool with the wheels i'm not even licensed to sit on that stool she sits
3:09
me on it and then she if if I'm remembering this correctly she picks up the phone and calls out code purple
3:17
which I I think the chuckles are nurses in the audience you know what that is you know like if you've been in a
3:23
hospital they have codes with different colors that they can blast out to the entire floor which says "Hey there's a life ordeath situation all available
3:30
personnel converge on this room and help." Code purple is we have a woozy husband who's about to pass out
3:38
and we need to bring him grape juice hence purple i think that's the only reason they didn't call it code pansy
3:44
and so I'm sitting on the stool in the corner and I now have like other people
3:49
are coming in and there are just as many nurses around me as there are around my wife who is in active labor making sure
3:55
I feel okay as I sip my little juice box it was awful um but all that to say um
4:05
bones are not my thing so please pray for my wife cuz I'm her nurse and I can't think about what's going on in her
4:11
leg right now um the point of all of that we've all been in situations thrown
4:17
into something where we just we feel illprepared ill equipped we don't exactly know what to say or what to do
4:23
how to handle the situation and today as we work our way through the first half of Mark chapter 9 we're going to see the
4:30
disciples get thrown into a couple of different situations that they do not know how to handle they they can't seem
4:36
to rise to the occasion they don't know what to say that they're just sort of lost and confused and they sort of botch
4:42
the situation but I want to zoom in on how we see Jesus respond to them respond
4:48
to the other people involved in these encounters and from that we're going to be able to pull a few truths about how
4:54
Jesus responds to us today in our flaws and imperfections and issues that we
5:00
face so if you're just jumping in with us or or maybe it's been a couple weeks
5:05
we have uh jumped back into our journey through the book of Mark and as Keith clarified a couple weeks ago uh the
5:12
first half roughly of the book seems to focus on Jesus as a king as the anointed
5:18
king his his authority his his his personhood as God and then he makes this
5:24
turn and then the the rest of his focus is on him as a suffering servant and so
5:30
so much of what he does and what he says and what he teaches and and tells to his disciples is about the suffering that he
5:37
has to endure that is coming as they make their way towards Jerusalem and so in Mark 9 we're going to pick it up in
5:44
verse one and it's kind of he's he's putting a punctuation at the end of a discussion he was just having with his
5:49
disciples about the suffering he's facing and it says this "And he said to them,"Truly I say to you there are some
5:55
standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power." And after six
6:01
days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John and led them up a high mountain by themselves and he was transfigured
6:07
before them and I want to pause here because it it can be easy to read Mark
6:12
uh 9:1 in isolation and and especially the words he uses at the end there where he talks about seeing the kingdom of God
6:18
after it is come with power our minds often go to Jesus's second coming and and you know new heaven new earth all
6:25
the stuff we read about in Revelation and if you read it that way and you read okay he's telling his disciples some of
6:30
you won't die before you see this we sit here 2,000 years later like well all of those guys died in the first century
6:36
what is this a misprint is this an error in the Bible no it is Jesus preparing
6:43
them for what's about to happen six days later that's even how Mark writes it he says they will see the kingdom of God after it has come with power and after
6:50
six days Jesus took three of his disciples some who are standing here today and showed them God's kingdom as
6:59
it comes with power with what they're about to see so a logical question why Peter James and John what about the
7:05
other nine guys uh these three we see throughout the gospels are are kind of part of this inner circle within the 12
7:13
uh not necessarily that Jesus was playing favorites just that he knew uh in his sovereignty in his godness that
7:20
there was a a special purpose and a plan for these three that they were going to be some key central figures in the
7:26
church as he ascends back to heaven and the gospel spreads and so every now and then he invites those three pulls them
7:32
aside and kind of gives them a a greater peak behind the curtain gives them some some special experiences some special uh
7:40
revelations that would serve them as they went on to build the church and so
7:45
this is what they witnessed starting in verse three in his transfiguration and his clothes became radiant intensely
7:51
white as no one on earth could bleach them and there appeared to them Elijah with Moses and they were talking with Jesus and and Peter said to Jesus "Rabbi
7:58
it is good that we are here let us make three tents one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah for he did not
8:04
know what to say for they were terrified." Did not know what to say is one of the most understated statements
8:10
in all of scripture um these three experienced something unimaginable something they were in no way prepared
8:16
for they get this literal glimpse into heaven almost as if at the top of that
8:21
mountain for just a a moment the the the bounds of space and time are sort of pulled apart and they get to see Jesus
8:28
as he truly is as God and they see these two other heroes of the faith who have have been off the planet for centuries
8:34
at this point and the three of them are having a conversation and Peter obviously doesn't know how to handle it
8:39
and if Peter had a life motto it would be when in doubt say something because he just always whatever the situation is
8:45
the first one to speak and usually says something kind of dumb um and puts his foot in his mouth he's a very relatable
8:51
figure and it's amazing to see uh how God grows him and what he becomes over time but there's a lot of significance
8:57
to this moment uh and we get a little bit of of clarity in the book of Luke he
9:03
recounts the same event but he provides a couple of details that Mark leaves out uh and one thing that he mentions is
9:09
that Moses and Elijah as they're talking with Jesus they're talking about his uh eventual departure from the earth
9:15
they're having a discussion about his crucifixion his death his resurrection um and his ascension and so this is kind
9:22
of a conversation that these three disciples get to witness and and listen in on and what helps us maybe even
9:28
understand Peter and his response a little bit better is that Luke tells us that the disciples were asleep they had
9:34
gone up on that mountain maybe they were praying or resting but they had fallen asleep and then they wake up to this
9:39
moment happening before them every parent kid knows that moment where
9:44
you are woken out of a dead sleep usually by your child who is snuck in like a ninja and rather than getting
9:50
your attention in a normal way stands over you like a serial killer waiting for you to wake up and there's that
9:57
moment where you're like trying to figure out where am I what's happening what you who is this what's going on now
10:03
imagine that moment in your brain but instead of your child who needs a drink you're staring at a picture of heaven
10:10
and three glowing heavenly beings talking you'd be a little confused you might start talking about tents who
10:16
knows but th this this huge moment is happening and it has a purpose that that
10:23
goes much beyond uh just sort of startling the disciples you see Moses and Elijah it's interesting that those
10:29
are the two people from the Old Testament there's lots of heroes in the Old Testament that these disciples would have been familiar with the fact that
10:35
it's Moses and Elijah points to what what God what what Jesus is trying to
10:41
communicate the the the thing he wants them to get and it's that Moses and Elijah in a very real way represent the
10:47
law and the prophets and that's sort of shorthand how Jesus continues to refer to the Old Testament the law and the
10:54
prophets the first five books of the Old Testament are the law given to Moses moses wrote them down as God inspired
11:01
them and gave the law to the Jewish people and then the prophets there's this whole collection of prophetic books
11:07
and and uh throughout the history of Israel of of God raising up people to call them to repentance uh and Elijah
11:15
sort of represent he's like the the OG goat prophet um we could get into like a
11:20
whole Jordan versus LeBron but you know the LeBron crowd's going to lose anyway um it it's it's like Elijah represents
11:28
just all of this prophetic work of God throughout the history of Israel and so you have these these representations of
11:34
the law and the prophets there with Jesus this this representing God's old
11:40
covenant with mankind that Jesus was about to fulfill and usher in a new covenant it is this huge spiritual
11:46
moment that these disciples get to witness and the point that Jesus wanted them to get more than anything else in
11:52
case there was any doubt is that Jesus is God over us he's over he's God over
11:58
them he's God over us that that he is not just a good man not just a teacher not just a preacher not some allegory
12:04
not just a great example of how to live that that Jesus is in fact God and that
12:10
we are called to humble ourselves under that and if there was any doubt from
12:15
that moment uh that the this event continues with one more step in verse 7 and a cloud overshadowed them and a
12:21
voice came out of the cloud this is my beloved son listen to him and suddenly looking around they no longer saw anyone
12:27
with them but Jesus only this cloud the the same cloud that we
12:32
see in the Old Testament that leads the Israelites out of Egypt and through the desert the cloud that fills the tabernacle and then later fills the
12:39
temple the cloud is this visible tangible presence of God that descends
12:45
around them envelops them and then the audible voice of God comes out clarifying who Jesus is that he is in
12:52
fact God it is this extremely powerful moment that that Jesus wanted these three in particular to witness because
12:59
it would be important for them to really understand who exactly he is and so to paraphrase just a bit they hike back
13:05
down the mountain uh and Jesus tells them not to share this moment until he has risen from the dead and these guys
13:11
are confused about a lot as you and I would both be they're they're confused
13:17
about what they've just witnessed like was this a dream or is this a a group hallucination what just happened and
13:23
then he says "Don't tell anyone." Like "Okay don't tell anyone until I've died and risen from the dead." Like hold on well this is new information what What
13:29
is happening so they're trying to piece all of this together and figure out what's going on and they they zoom in on
13:35
at least this rising from the dead thing saying "Maybe we can get some clarification maybe we misunderstood because that sounds rising from the dead
13:41
would require you being dead and we really don't want you to be dead." So verse 11 they asked him "Why do the
13:47
scribes that's the the the religious leaders of the day why do they say that first Elijah must come?" And he said to
13:53
them "Elijah does come first to restore all things and how is it written of the son of man that he should suffer many
13:58
things and be treated with contempt but I tell you that Elijah has come and they did to him whatever they pleased as it
14:04
is written of him." See the the religious leaders had correctly read in Malachi that that a prophet similar to
14:10
Elijah would prepare the way for Jesus and now these guys are essentially saying to Jesus like "Okay we we
14:16
understand what scripture says we think we are pretty clear that you are the Messiah but we saw you first and now we
14:23
just saw Elijah so surely we're misunderstanding something and and I think if we read between the lines and
14:29
the way Jesus answers them they're hoping that they are completely misunderstanding this whole suffering death resurrection thing that there's
14:36
got to be some way to sidestep that because we don't like the sound of that and that's why I think Jesus clarifies in verse 12 that yes Elijah comes first
14:43
and also those same scriptures you're alluding to that talk about Elijah coming they also are very clear that I
14:48
am going to suffer and die and that's part of the plan but Jesus patiently clarifies this a and we could you know
14:57
again it's easy to look at the disciples and say "Come on guys get it together." But we do the same kind of thing we we
15:04
try to get scripture to say what we want it to say don't we we or to not say
15:09
something that it seems pretty clearly to say just because we don't like the implications just a few that that are
15:15
pretty popular out there the the belief that scripture says God wants you to be happy healthy and wealthy it doesn't say
15:20
that wish it did it'd be great it's not what it says or that if I give my life to Jesus everything is going to be
15:26
better and easier and my life's just going to be sunshine and unicorns for the rest of my days it doesn't say that
15:32
either or that that scripture must say that falling out of love with your spouse or the the kids moving out must
15:39
be must be biblical grounds for divorce right no it doesn't say that or the one
15:45
that's very very common that surely the Bible is vague or at least open to the idea of sex outside of marriage because
15:51
I mean come on it's the 21st century who even waits anymore does it really say that yeah the Bible's actually really
15:58
clear on that we just don't often like what it says and so the point that I
16:03
think Jesus is making as he answers their question and then even seems to answer the unasked question behind their
16:08
question is that Jesus's word is clear to us it is clear especially when it
16:14
comes to who God is how we are to be saved and how he expects us to live the Bible is incredibly clear and the
16:21
disciples should have known the answer to the question they were asking about this Elijah coming first what's that all
16:28
about jesus had already explained it that's recorded in Matthew 11 that John the Baptist was in fact this prophet who
16:34
that was quote in the spirit of Elijah who came to pave the way the Romans
16:39
really Herod killed him and that's what verse 13 refers to that Elijah has already come and they did to him what
16:45
they were going to do which is also written of him so they come down from this literal mountaintop experience
16:52
which was certainly uh very impactful for the disciples but also meaningful for Jesus as well and what do They step
16:59
into verse 14 and when they came to the disciples the other nine who were were
17:04
left down the mountain they saw a great crowd around them and the scribes arguing with them and immediately all the crowd when they saw him were greatly
17:11
amazed and ran up to him and greeted him and he asked them "What are you arguing with about with them?" And someone from
17:16
the crowd answered him "Teacher I brought my son to you for he has a spirit that makes him mute and whenever it seizes him it throws him down and he
17:22
foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid so I asked your disciples to cast it out and they were not able." And he
17:28
answered them 'Oh faithless generation how long am I to be with you how long am I to bear with you bring him to me the
17:36
these are the the highs and lows of life right that they're on a mountaintop in this this moment of heavenly glory which
17:44
even for Jesus personally as he's fully God and fully man uh is certainly an encouraging moment for him talking with
17:51
Moses and Elijah about the what he is heading into and then he comes down and
17:56
he's met with the chaos and he's met with crowds demanding more of him it's sort of the the expectations of what
18:02
could be or what should be and then reality and sometimes it hits just that fast doesn't it you're you're riding
18:08
high like everything couldn't be better and then out of nowhere you're at the lowest of lows i think one of the the
18:14
clearest moments of that in my life is uh my wedding day which sounds is a horrible way to start that story let me
18:19
clarify uh not because of my wife or our marriage um we both my wife and I how do
18:25
I say this delicately were very excited for married people activities that would come later that day uh and at the time
18:31
we were engaged and planning our wedding we had a lot of friends who had been married just a few years they were still kind of newlyweds and we heard from
18:37
multiple people that hey you you may be excited but that that wedding day is so long and so grueling and by the time we
18:43
got back to the hotel it's the middle of the night and we were just like man you just want to go to bed and we can do married people activities tomorrow and I
18:50
said "Over my dead body is that gonna happen?" And so we devised a plan that we thought was brilliant it was a
18:56
Saturday brunch wedding we're going to get married at 10:00 a.m who doesn't love breakfast food everyone wins our
19:02
guests will get the whole rest of their Saturdays back and we will be out of there by like 1:00 and we'll have the whole rest of the day for married people
19:08
activities and so it worked like clock like like a charm at 1:00 we're rolling
19:13
out of the venue and we drove across town to this nice hotel that my parents had generously booked for us and I went
19:18
skipping up to the counter and said "One hotel room please." And the lady said "Oh yes hello Mr boris i see your
19:24
reservation right here so welcome to our hotel unfortunately check-in is not until 3:00
19:31
your room is not clean they're still working on it." And I said "Okay well thank you Amber uh I'm going to need you
19:39
to find me a room there are some activities that need to happen post haste if you will." And she said "I
19:47
don't know why I spoke like a medieval king but I did." And she's like "Okay well I I understand i'm putting a note
19:53
in here i will see if I can move your room up the list and and we can get you in a little earlier but for now please
19:58
make yourself comfortable in the lobby you can get a drink in the bar." Ladies and gentlemen that was the longest 90
20:04
minutes of my entire life and it it was just the the the elevated like so excite
20:11
excited so much anticipation like this is working perfectly what a beautiful day we are now married and then just the
20:17
lowest of lows and this this is how life works sometimes we have this this expectation
20:23
or this this incredible moment that then seems to almost like just flip a coin
20:28
and it goes completely the opposite way and this is somewhat the the situation
20:34
Jesus and the disciples find themselves in so So what is going on here what's the the nuances here of this story it is
20:40
perfectly normal for people to bring victims of demon possession to Jesus the the gospels are are just full of it and
20:47
he comes down from this mountaintop experience and he's met with with just chaos and and things that he you could
20:54
say shouldn't have to deal with necessarily because what's interesting is in Mark 6 Jesus had given his disciples the authority to drive out
21:00
demons and he had sent them out and it says they drove out many demons like they have done this before and so for
21:07
some reason this this man brings his son to the disciples the other nine and and they say "Oh yeah demon we got this we
21:13
know what to do and it doesn't work for some reason and there's some debate
21:18
about what exactly causes it not to work but I think at least part of the equation is what we see in Jesus's
21:24
response in verse 19 where he says "Oh faithless generation." Now it's it's an issue of faith and he
21:31
could be referring to the scribes the religious leaders that are arguing with his disciples he he could be referring
21:36
to the father of the boy which we'll get to in a minute he could be referring to to the disciples and their lack of faith
21:43
or their reliance on themselves rather than on the power of God to cast out the demon it could be all three it could be
21:49
the situation that he's just surveying the chaos and saying "Ah guys if you if
21:54
you just understood who I am and what I'm doing you would realize it doesn't have to be this way it could be all of
22:02
that kind of wrapped up into one." And and Jesus's seemingly exasperated response really echoes the prophets of
22:08
the Old Testament where whatever the sin or the idolatry or the issue that the prophets are calling out they're they're
22:13
always talking about this this fundamental foundational issue of faith
22:19
and that that it is a lack of faith that is resulting in their their sin or or
22:24
the the struggles that they're facing and and and faith is still a big deal to
22:29
us today hey Hebrews 11:6 says "Without faith it is impossible to please God."
22:34
Faith is is foundational it is crucial in our relationship with God and and I
22:40
want to be clear as as we may have a lot of different ideas when we hear the word faith it's not this cosmic test of human
22:47
beings that God is intentionally trying to keep some things hidden and say "Well let's just see maybe they'll you know if
22:52
they can have enough faith to believe in what they can't see then then maybe I'll be kind to them." That that's not what
22:57
it is faith at its core is it's a call to humble ourselves before a holy and
23:03
incomprehensible God it's to answer that question for ourselves are we willing to accept that we are not gods that we are
23:11
finite that we are limited that we don't know everything and that the God of the
23:16
universe by his very nature will will have some mystery involved we can't
23:22
always figure everything out but can we humble ourselves and trust him even when we don't fully get it
23:28
see what Jesus is getting at here with his disciples with this father uh with the religious leaders is that Jesus
23:34
requires faith from us that is what he expects of us that is what he requires
23:40
but before you get discouraged because maybe you came in here in the middle of some sort of faith crisis or you're
23:45
wrestling with some doubts and and some stuff you you can't quite figure out and you may be the the super analytical type
23:52
that even as we read the description of the boy's symptoms you're thinking "Well that sounds kind of like a seizure disorder." And and they just didn't have
23:58
the medical knowledge we have today so they attributed that to a demon and and this is this is the tension that we
24:05
always live in and I get it because I have I am analytical to a fault but but
24:10
it's this tricky notion that that scripture is written for us it's not written to us i have the distinct
24:18
pleasure one of the main things I do around here is is is I run this this school we've developed for people
24:24
wanting to go into ministry it's a one-year residency and we dive deep into the Bible um and train up these young
24:30
men and women who who desire to devote their their working lives and their their careers to to the kingdom of God
24:37
and so as we study scripture we're constantly faced with issues like this where we we have to re reconcile okay
24:43
the book of Mark is written to first century Jewish Christians who lived in a completely different world and worldview
24:49
than we do but this is still inspired by God and preserved for us and applies to
24:55
us and how do we how do we navigate that and it's not always as as cleancut and
25:00
black and white as we like to to think and it can be possible to look back on
25:06
civilizations and generations before with with condescension and think "Oh well they just didn't know so they just had to attribute everything to
25:12
supernatural means." And there there may be some some fairness in some of that argument but also at the same time
25:18
there's a humility I think we we must have that maybe we don't know everything
25:24
that that maybe if they overspiritualize we underspiritualize that we over scienceify it's a word I
25:31
just made up right now uh that that we just try to find a a natural reason to completely exclude the supernatural
25:37
which excludes so much that goes on in the world around us that maybe it's
25:43
possible that that we sometimes uh just discount the the blurry line between our
25:49
body and our spirit and how we are created both we are physical and spiritual and those two affect each
25:55
other way more than we realize and maybe that line between mental and physical
26:00
health and demonic oppression or possession is a little blurriier than we want to admit that it is either way
26:07
whatever you want to look back and diagnose this young boy with Jesus who just proved he was God encounters this
26:13
and is about to heal the boy and it will be by supernatural means he looked at him and diagnosed him with a demon and
26:19
took action that fit with that verse 20 and they brought the boy to him and when
26:25
the spirit saw him immediately it convulsed the boy and he fell on the ground and rolled about foaming at the mouth and Jesus asked his father "How
26:32
long has this been happening to him?" And he said "From childhood." And it is often cast him into fire and into water
26:38
to destroy him but if you can do anything have compassion on us and help us this father in his desperation with
26:45
his last thread of hope and again the probably bringing him to Jesus was his
26:51
last thread and then he met the disciples who said "Oh yeah Jesus isn't here right now but we can handle this." And they couldn't so now that he's face
26:56
to face with Jesus he's probably even more doubtful that that this can actually happen and he let his true
27:02
feelings he let his doubts show and Jesus responds to him he he he
27:08
catches that line if you can do anything in verse 23 Jesus said to him if you can all things are possible for one who
27:14
believes immediately the father of the child cried out and said 'I believe help my unbelief
27:21
i think those are some of the most honest words in scripture they are so profound this I do believe i have I I am
27:29
I want to believe i believe some but I I still have some of this unbelief some of
27:34
this doubt some of this fear please help me with that and maybe if you're honest
27:39
with yourself you can relate you're you're in here today with with a belief with a desire to believe but there's a
27:45
lot of intellectual doubts swirling around some questions you got to get answered maybe it's more personal there's some pain or some tragedy in
27:52
your past that that that you are trying to reconcile the good God that you read in the Bible and hear about at church
27:58
why would he let that happen maybe you believe that God can set people free from their addictions and habits and the
28:04
things that hang them up and and as much as you try that doesn't seem to be working you still feel chained to something and you don't know why or you
28:11
thought becoming a Christian would have a certain result that it would feel a certain way and it is it is different
28:16
than you expected and you're you're trying to wrap your head around I if you're if you're doing it right or if if
28:22
God is really there and if that's you are exactly where this desperate father was at and we should be encouraged by
28:29
the way Jesus responds to this man's imperfect faith with patience and with
28:34
grace verse 25 he rebuked the unclean spirit saying to it you mute and deaf spirit I command you come out of him and
28:41
never enter him again and after crying out and convulsing him terribly it came out and the boy was like a corpse so
28:47
that most of them said "He is dead." But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose
28:53
jesus immediately healed the boy in response to to even the flawed faith of
28:59
the father the boy's father admitted what what many of us don't have the courage or maybe
29:04
the self-awareness to admit which is that that even on our best day we are
29:09
complex mixes o of faith and unbelief of of belief and doubt of good
29:18
motivations and bad motivations that that that we just we always have some
29:24
element this push and pull of the spirit and the flesh that Paul talks about in Romans 7 that even In our greatest
29:30
moments there's still some of that fleshly sinful imperfection mixed in there and the boy's father is just
29:37
honest about that and the good news is that Jesus understands that and he's patient with us in that see Jesus is
29:44
merciful understanding and patient with us jesus didn't wait for the dad to fix his
29:51
faith he didn't say like he didn't respond to the I believe help my unbelief and say "Well I mean when you
29:56
get that unbelief taken care of we can take care of your son here." No Jesus acted in response to the imperfect faith
30:03
of the father which is perfectly keeping with the character of God throughout scripture in Psalm 103 it says "As a
30:09
father shows compassion to his children so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him for he knows our frame he
30:15
remembers that we are dust he knows that we are human he knows that we are flawed
30:20
and yet he shows compassion." In Hebrews 4:15 it's talking about Jesus as a high priest and says "We do not have a high
30:27
priest who is unable to sympathize with our weakness." He gets it though he is
30:33
perfect he understands that we are not and he still responds with mercy and understanding and patience
30:40
and God knows that we are perpetually flawed that that as scripture says our righteousness is as filthy rags before
30:47
him because he is so holy and perfect and God could condemn us for that it would be holy and just for him to say
30:53
'Well you are imperfect and I am perfect and therefore we are separated and there is no hope but that is not what God does
31:00
he responds with grace and mercy and and someone in here needs to hear this today
31:06
uh that this is not uh a license to just sin and to give up trying and say "Well I'm imperfect and God knows that and
31:12
he's cool with it so I'm just going to do whatever I want." No scriptur is very clearly against that mindset but if you
31:19
grew up with a an image of God who was little more than just this stern keeper of this massive do and don't list that
31:26
he was always disappointed that when you imagine God looking at you you see this stern angry disappointed face then you
31:33
need to let this sink in if you are in Christ if you have placed your faith in him you have trusted that his death on
31:40
the cross was the punishment for your sins and because of that you can have a fresh start and you can be reconnected
31:46
to God if that is you then all of your imperfections are nailed to that cross
31:52
the the punishment has already been handed out but not to you but on Jesus
31:57
that is the mercy of God and because of that when God looks at you he does not see your imperfections he does not see
32:03
your sin he does not see even maybe the the somewhat selfish motives that you did the right thing for he just sees his
32:11
son or his daughter whom he delights in it deeply delights in you and the
32:19
following verse from that Hebrews 4 passage where Jesus understands our weaknesses because he was also tempted
32:25
in every way but was still without sin verse 16 says "Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of
32:30
grace that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need that we
32:37
can confidently stand before God knowing that he is not angry that he is not disappointed but he is just so delighted
32:45
to be with you and he does not see your sin he has cast it as far as the east is from the west because Jesus took that
32:53
punishment for you and what's even even more amazing is that while he is patient
32:58
and understanding he also loves us enough to continue to to grow us and to
33:03
draw us out of those things that that harm us and that harm the other people around us he grows us in our faith and
33:10
our holiness and our love so for just a second I want to ask you to to close your eyes for a minute and just just sit
33:17
before the Lord for a second and evaluate what is he doing in your life what's he doing in your heart how is the
33:23
Holy Spirit speaking to you right now because God is patient but he's also
33:28
purifying is is he purifying you right now is there something that that he is calling
33:34
you to leave at the foot of the cross to repent and to walk away from he is gracious and yet he also grows us
33:43
is he actively growing you working on you is some of the the struggle you're facing right now him just sanding off
33:49
some of those rough edges and and growing you in your faith he is so merciful and he also molds us
33:56
into the image of his son how is he molding you right now how is he uh
34:02
drawing out the the the fruit of the spirit the characteristics of his son in
34:07
your life as he replaces the the selfish and sinful desires that we naturally are
34:12
drawn to he will meet you exactly where you're at
34:17
but he loves you too much to leave you there and maybe right now in this moment the the best that you could offer the
34:24
the the the most that you could say to God is "I I do believe i I want to believe help my unbelief
34:32
maybe you just pray that honest prayer of the father in this story and let God
34:37
meet you there and help your unbelief you can open your eyes
34:44
we want to make walking with Jesus as as
34:49
clear as possible around here and and so that's why every week we end up talking about these next step cards that are on
34:55
your program that are in the app and in a room this size people are at all different places in their walk with the
35:00
Lord but but if there's a step you need to take maybe it's at the very beginning it's the I need to figure out this whole
35:06
Jesus dying for my sin thing there's there's a box you can check we would love to follow up with you and talk you through that maybe you felt you've given
35:14
your life to Jesus but you've been holding off on getting baptized for whatever reason or you believed you had to get cleaned up enough to get baptized
35:21
and that's not at all what scripture says and maybe it's time to finally take that step and to go public with your
35:27
faith in Christ or whatever else is going on whatever else you're wrestling with maybe you just need someone to pray
35:32
with and at the end of this last song we'll have a prayer team up here who would love to to talk with you and pray
35:37
with you try to encourage you but but today if you're if you're wrestling with something or you know there's a step you
35:43
need to take why don't you fill out the card and check that box and we would love to walk with you as you grow closer
35:50
to the Lord let's pray and then we're going to worship together with one last song
35:57
god we we thank you we love you uh we are in awe of the the mercy and the
36:03
grace that we do not deserve but that you offer us thank you that you are so patient you know that we are humans that
36:10
we are flawed that we're going to fall down again and again and yet you love us and you pick us back up and you you grow
36:17
us and walk with us and and draw us closer to yourself even as we imperfectly reach out to you god I pray
36:24
right now that that you would speak clearly that you would draw us into whatever step we need to take to to walk
36:31
with you lord we love you thank you for Jesus it's in his name we pray amen
